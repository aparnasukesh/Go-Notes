                             HTTP STATUS CODE 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that a web server sends as part of its response to an HTTP request made by a client (such as a web browser or application). These codes provide information about the outcome of the request and help both the client and server understand how to proceed.

In simpler terms, think of HTTP status codes as messages that tell you what happened when you interact with a website. They're like little notes from the server explaining what's going on.

Here's a breakdown of some common HTTP status codes and what they mean:

In summary, HTTP status codes are like little messages from a website's server, explaining what happened when you made a request. They're a quick way to understand whether your request worked, if there's an issue, or if something has changed.

1. 200 OK: The server successfully processed the request and returned the requested resource. Everything is fine.

2. 201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result. For example, after submitting a form to create a new user account.

3. 204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request, but there is no additional information to send back. It's often used in cases where the request didn't require a response body.

4. 400 Bad Request: The server couldn't understand the request due to malformed syntax or other client-side errors.

5. 401 Unauthorized: The request requires authentication, and the user hasn't provided valid credentials or hasn't logged in yet.

6. 403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but the server refuses to authorize it. The client doesn't have permission to access the requested resource.

7. 404 Not Found: The server couldn't find the requested resource. This is the classic "page not found" error.

8. 405 Method Not Allowed: The request method (like GET, POST, etc.) is not supported for the requested resource.

9. 500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message indicating that something went wrong on the server's side. It's often used when the server encounters an unexpected condition that prevents it from fulfilling the request.

10. 503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request due to overloading or maintenance of the server. It's like saying, "I'm busy right now, come back later."

11. 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been moved to a new location, and you should update your bookmarks or links to the new URL.

12. 302 Found (or 307 Temporary Redirect): The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location. The original URL might still be used in the future.

These are just a few important HTTP status codes. There are many more, each serving a specific purpose to help communicate the outcome of an HTTP request between clients and servers.
